/**
 * Log a message with a log level.

 * @param level (input) The log level
 * @param message (input) The log message
 * @discussion If you create your own log target this method must be implemented thread-safe and write the log message atomically. So, basically, do not modify any variables outside the scope of this function, and if, e.g. you are using printf to write your message, then make one call to printf and not several. As a side note: In a POSIX system, printf is likely re-entrant but thread-safe and writes atomically due to the usage of flockfile/funlockfile, which can be seen as some sort of mutex associated with the file handle. So, while using printf or a function behaving similarly, serves our purpose, it can very well present a severe bottleneck to the logging system.
